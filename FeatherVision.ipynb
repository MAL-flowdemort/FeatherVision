    "<p>Ornithology enthusiasts and zoologists are people we thank for protecting and discovering new species on almost daily basis. Their jobs are alredy extremely difficult with the amount of information they have to keep track of while always being on the lookout for rare sightings of exotic birds.\n",
    "With FeatherVision their job will be made much easier, when it comes to identifying numerous different species of birds.</p>\n",
    "<p>The objective of our project is to create a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying bird species based on visual attributes in images. This way anyone could become a beginner ornithologist by simply capturing an image of their own and find out the details of the fauna in their local area. And for those advanced in the field, they could spend more time taking care of endangered species and researching by decreasing the precious time needed to properly identify these species.</p> \n",

Since our dataset is fully lableled, meaning all the pictures have a label (bird species name) that the model can check, we chose the <b>Supervised Learning</b> approach. This means we will most likely choose a classification model to classify an image to a specie's name.</p>"

It has a large number of training images (almost 85,000!) and includes over 500 different kinds of birds. This will help our model learn to identify lots of different bird species. We wanted a dataset with lots of high-quality images, good bird visibility, and this one fits us well. Important note is that all the images are photographed and not AI generated. While there are a few things to keep in mind, like each picture only having one bird, which can be good or bad, and also the images are 80% male, we believe this dataset is a good choice for our bird classification project.\n",
