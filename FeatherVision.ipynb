    "We have decided to use birds classification dataset from <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species\">kaggle</a>. It has a large number of training images (almost 85,000!) and includes over 500 different kinds of birds. This will help our model learn to identify lots of different bird species. We wanted a dataset with lots of high-quality images, good bird visibility, and this one fits us well. Important note is that all the images are photographed and not AI generated. While there are a few things to keep in mind, like each picture only having one bird, which can be good or bad, and also the images are 80% male, we believe this dataset is a good choice for our bird classification project.\n",
